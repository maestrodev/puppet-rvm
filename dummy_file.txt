Hello, World!
This is a useless file just to trigger a travis-ci build on the repo, as-is.
I suspect that the build will fail, since .travis.yml has it delete Gemfile.lock
before bundling.   It settles on a recent version of beaker-rspec that depends on
a more recent version of ruby than selected by .travis.yml, so the bundle fails.
(I'm not sure why it doesn't look for an older version that has lower ruby requirements)

But, point being, I want to make sure it's not failing because of my PR changes.
